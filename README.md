This is a Java desktop app made using JavaFx with the integration of SQLite. This desktop app can store your password locally on your desktop, as it also provides encryption for 
all the data, so that people can't just open the database and view all the data. Overall, its a user-friendly app which allows for multiple users to use it (they just have to make an account).
